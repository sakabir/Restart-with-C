1. What is a keyword and what are the keywords in your program? 
   ans: Keywords are predefined, reserved words used in programming that have special meanings to the compiler.
        Keywords are part of the syntax and they cannot be used as an identifier.
   "int and return"

2. What is an identifier and what are the identifiers in your program?
  ans: Identifier refers to name given to entities such as variables, functions, structures etc.
        Identifiers must be unique.
  => Rules for naming identifiers----
    a.A valid identifier can have letters (both uppercase and lowercase letters), digits and underscores.
    b.The first letter of an identifier should be either a letter or an underscore.
    c.You cannot use keywords as identifiers.
    d.There is no rule on how long an identifier can be. 
      However, you may run into problems in some compilers if the identifier is longer than 31 characters.

    "main, as its function"

3. How you can add a comment?
  ans: there are two types of comments :
  => Single line comment
      \\this is single line comment
  => Multi-line comment
      /* this is
      a multiline comment */
      
4. How whitespace and comments are treated?
  ans: A line containing only whitespace, possibly with a comment, is known as a blank line, and a C compiler totally ignores it.
      Whitespace is the term used in C to describe blanks, tabs, newline characters and comments.
      Whitespace separates one part of a statement from another and enables the compiler to identify where one element in a statement.
